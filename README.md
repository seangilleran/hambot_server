# Hambot (Server)

[Hambot](http://hambot.seangilleran.com/) is a small software/hardware project designed to keep tabs on a hamster. It's built with Python on a Raspberry Pi. The source code is all avaliable on GitHub; the client application is [here](https://github.com/seangilleran/hambot_client), and the server is [here](https://github.com/seangilleran/hambot_server).

The project grew out of a need to provide a more comfortable enclosure for my wife's new hamster, Moolah. We originally had a metal cage, but Moolah kept chewing on the bars. When we replaced it with a plastic tub, we were worried that, despite the air holes we had drilled, Moolah would be too hot. To provide extra ventilation, I attached some old PC case fans to the enclosure and wired them to the 5v rail of my Raspberry Pi. Since we will be leaving for a research trip soon, _sans_ Moolah, and since it seemed like the Raspberry Pi was being underutilized, I decided to try and set up a system that would let us check in with her every now and then.

The client hardware has four parts: the Raspberry Pi, the fans, an old USB webcam, and a temperature probe. Every hour, the Pi runs a Python script that takes a picture from the webcam, takes a reading from the probe, and uploads them to a server. Images are taken from the pygame Camera module, which is a little buggy, so unfortunately the Pi also has to restart every time it does this.

The server software is also written in Python; on top of the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. It collects the uploads and serves them out via a small webpage and via a sort-of-RESTful API. Since it is not a package that calls for heroic security measures, I decided, as an experiment, to see if I could use [py-enigma](http://py-enigma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the token encrpytion mechanism. As a student of history, it seemed like an appropriate choice! The wrapper I built ([here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-enigma-operator/0.6)) seems to work quite well, though I doubt it would hold up to any very serious attempt to break it.

The webcam is not very good, and Moolah has a tendency to be out and about only when it is very confused about the light level, but occasionally it catches her doing something hamsterly and adorable. The source code is open for use under the MIT license, [here](https://github.com/seangilleran/hambot_server/blob/api/LICENSE). Feel free to mess around with it, and let me know if you have questions about it!
